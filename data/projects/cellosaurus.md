#### Description
Two tasks should be carried out concerning the Cellosaurus (http://web.expasy.org/cellosaurus/):

##### Task 1

-	Development of a Web-based tool to compare a user entered STR Marker profile for a cell line with all the STR marker data stored in the Cellosaurus. The program would run an algorithm similar to that described in:

* https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3772516/

-	The program would run on the ExPASy server.

##### Task 2

-	 Development of a Wikidata "bot" (https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Bots) to enter some of the data stored in the Cellosaurus into Wikidata. The exact specification of the mapping of Cellosaurus data into Wikidata properties/clains and statements is being finalized:

- The bot would be ran at every release of the Cellosaurus to update the existing Wikidata cell line concepts and create new ones for cell lines newly entered at each release.
